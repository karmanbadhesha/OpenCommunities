Follow-up Question

If given more time, to improve the quality of my application there are a few quality of life features I would of implemented. One of those is
to limit the number of results per page, and allow the user to browse through multiple pages of communities/homes. Another feature is a search function,
allowing the user to filter the results. In the future, allowing verified users to add homes/communities through a new endpoint would also be a good feature to have.
